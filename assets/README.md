# About the `assets` folder in this repo

## What is the `assets` folder used for:

In this porject, the role of the `assets` folder is to host the models you want to display.

In addition, this folder also hosts the AR marker mandatory for an AR through QrCode experience: the  [marker.patt](./marker.patt) file.

There is a dedicated documentation about creating your own marker.

In this repo, one of the *default* AR marker is used: [the one available through AR.js studio](https://ar-js-org.github.io/studio/assets/default-marker.png) and simplu displaying AR in dedicated box.
