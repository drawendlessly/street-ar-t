# The street-ar-t project

## A simple webapp to display AR models from an AR QrCode

Scan the following QrCode with a compatible device and you should see [this bowser model](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bowser-fa17f94ae350416f86c35db7c0e129c3).

## A simple idea

The all idea about this project came from [Waxhead](https://www.instagram.com/waxheadart), a street artist from Montr√©al.

He wanted to use [Augmented Reality QrCode](https://medium.com/chialab-open-source/how-to-deliver-ar-on-the-web-only-with-a-qr-code-e24b7b61f8cb) to display 3D models of his sculptures in the streets.

This project is a very simple webapp built on top of [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/) librairies that do not necessitate any backend code to run but could still be used to display a variety of models.

Each model to display is associated with an URL that can be used to generate an [AR QrCode](https://medium.com/chialab-open-source/how-to-deliver-ar-on-the-web-only-with-a-qr-code-e24b7b61f8cb) to trigger the experience.

Everything has been built to leverage the ability to host public website on Github pages and this repo can be forked to create a base for your own webapp, hosting your own models.

See the [documentation](./docs) for details on how to create your own AR webapp hosted on Github.

## A simple code

**Disclaimer : I am NOT an AR specialist ! (nor I am even a real frontend developper!)**

This project is mainly an [AFrame component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/core/component.html) to handle the logic and some html and css for the web part.

It must be seen as a result of a hackathon as everything has been done quite quickly trying not to be too dirty.

**It is not done as it *should be* done!**

Especially:
* The [AFrame component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/core/component.html) *should be* split at least in two different components to separate the resolution of the model from the URL and the messages display logic. 
* Each component *should be* a proper [AFrame component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/core/component.html) built via the [angle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angle/) command line tool. Therefore, each component *should be* unit-tested and distributed properly.

On the other hand, the all js code is a 120 lines source and do the job. There is no framework except the [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/) stack and everything is in vanilla JS. No tooling neither... so nothing to maintain (except maybe the aframe version in the index.html to ensure future compatibility).

The amount of boilerplate to provide proper software architecture and quality was not on the scope of this little hackathon...

This approach is a rough tradeoff but the result can still be used to display 3D models triggered by an [AR QrCode](https://medium.com/chialab-open-source/how-to-deliver-ar-on-the-web-only-with-a-qr-code-e24b7b61f8cb).

There are also basic customization possbilities offered for people that would like to reuse this project to host their own models (see the [documentation](./docs) for details about that).

And once again, you can use Github pages to expose all your pretty models to the web for free. Or for the price of a domain name if you want the control on that aspect.

So you can focus on creating your models, creating your stencils (or stickers, or whatever works for your QrCode) and put art in the streets !

## Credits

[AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/) for their incredible library. The first prototype for [street-ar-t](https://github.com/nihilux-org/street-ar-t) has been built using a sample of code generated by their [AR.js studio](https://ar-js-org.github.io/studio/) tool.

[AFrame](https://aframe.io) because it's the engine under [AR.js](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/) and they provide complete documentation and a powerful extendability based on their component architecture.

[three.js](https://threejs.org) because it's the engine under [AFrame](https://aframe.io).

[loading.io](https://loading.io) because they offer free spinner based on modern CSS technologies. Every spinner on this project come from their [CSS spinner gallery](https://loading.io/css/).
